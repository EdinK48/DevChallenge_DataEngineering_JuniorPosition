<p>This is a coding challenge from a famous German IT company and served as a first screening test for a Associate Data Engineer role. The PDF file contains the instructions for a card game and the ipynb file the implementation.
The code is written in a functional design with Python. Each function contains descriptions of what each function does, input and output parameters, and type hints. Enforcing data types can be done with
assert statements in this case. Some simple "mock up" test cases were implemented at the end of the ipynb script. My focus was on creating a neat procedural code structure representing the card game described
in the instructions.</p>
